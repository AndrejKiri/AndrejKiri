## 👋 Hi, my name is Andrej and I am a Staff UX researcher @ Grafana Labs. 

I talk to users about their experience with digital products and pass their feedback along to the product teams so they can improve the products.

<!-- I do interviews, surveys, usability tests and many more.  -->

### About me
- My background is in Computer Science and Sociology. This rather unusual combination turned out to be extremely useful for me. On one hand, it gave me solid understanding of information technologies and modern software engineering. On the other hand, I spent a whole lot of time learning and practicing various methodologies used for studying people.
- I started my career in 2014 in a consultancy, then moved to a big corporate, and later settled in the startup world. It has been more than 9 years since I started doing UX research and I still love it. Currently, I am excited about Developer Experience, especially IT operations. More details in my [CV](https://github.com/AndrejKiri/AndrejKiri/blob/main/CV.md).
- I grew up in southern Slovakia. Now I live in the Czech Republic (CET/CEST time). With my wife, we have two little kids. When the kids fall asleep, I play Dota 2.

### Working with me
- By my nature, I strive to deliver high-quality work and I expect others to aspire to it as well. But, this is a double-edged sword. Not to fall into the trap of perfectionism, I work hard to scope my work appropriately and iterate.
- Sometimes I need time to absorb new information and form an opinion. I often wait to speak in group settings until my thoughts are clear and I believe I can contribute positively to the discussion. Because of this, I prefer async work and I appreciate it when I get materials for meetings in advance.
- I gravitate towards transparency and vulnerability both in my work and personal life. I believe being open about one's mistakes, doubts and fears is better than building a facade of an ideal person because it allows me and others to learn and grow faster.
- I take advantage of the flexibility that comes with working in a distributed, fully-remote company. Sometimes I start working a little later or go for a walk with my kids after lunch. Sometimes I work during evenings or weekends. I like it this way. To make sure this flexibility doesn't harm my work or personal life, I keep detailed track of my time in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

### Trivia
- In MBTI personality typology I score between Advocate [INFJ-T](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality) and Architect [INTJ-T](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality) types. I can relate to both.
- My native language is Slovak and I am fluent also in English, Russian, and Czech languages. I learned Spanish and German as well. 
- I play Dota 2. Since 2014, I spent more than 3800 hours on it and even though my matchmaking rating oscilates around 2k (means "rather bad"), I regret nothing.
