  ### About me
  - My background is in Computer Science and Sociology. This rather unusual combination turned out to be extremely useful for me. 
  - I started my career in 2014 in a consultancy, then moved to a big corporate, and later settled in the startup world. It has been more than 7 years since I started doing UX research and I still love it. Currently, I am excited about Developer Experience, especially IT operations. More details in my [CV](https://github.com/AndrejKiri/AndrejKiri/blob/ccfa33fc4baef82f32d1fd9278aa9ea44329faa0/CV.md).
  - I grew up in southern Slovakia. Now I live in the Czech Republic. With my wife, we have two little kids and an evil cat. When the kids fall asleep, I play Dota 2. Recently I realized that I love gardening.

  ### Trivia
  - In MBTI personality type I score between Advocate [INFJ-T](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality) and Architect [INTJ-T](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality) types. I can relate to both.
  - I can blind type in both latin and cyrilic
  - My Dota 2 MMR is 2k (means "rather bad")
