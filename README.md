## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Andrej and I am a UX researcher. 

I talk to users about their experience with digital products and transfer their feedback to the product teams and leaders so they can deliver better work. At my work I also do a fair amount of digging into numbers from surveys, analytics, reviews.

  <summary>About me and some trivia</summary>

### About me
- I have a background in Computer Science and Sociology. This pretty obscure combination turned out to be extremely useful for my work. 
- I started my career in 2014 in a consultancy, then moved to a corporate and later settled in the startup world. It has been more than 7 years now since I started doing UX research and I still love it. Currently, I am excited about Developer Experience, especially IT operations. Check more details on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrej-kiripolsk%C3%BD-22042843/).
- I grew up in southern Slovakia. Now I live in the Czech Republic. With my wife, we have 2 little kids and an evil cat. When the kids fall asleep in the evening, I play Dota 2. Recently I realized that I love gardening.

### Trivia
- In MBTI personality type I score between Advocate [INFJ-T](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality) and Architect [INTJ-T](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality) types. I can relate to both.
- I can blind type in both latin and cyrilic
- My Dota 2 MMR is 2k (means "rather bad")
