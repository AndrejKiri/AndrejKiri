## 👋 Hi, my name is Andrej and I am a UX researcher. 

I talk to users about their experience with digital products and pass their feedback along to the product teams so they can improve it.

<!-- I do interviews, surveys, usability tests and many more.  -->

### About me
- My background is in Computer Science and Sociology. This rather unusual combination turned out to be extremely useful for me. On one hand, it gave me solid understanding of information technologies and modern software engineering. On the other hand, I spent a whole lot of time learning and practicing various methodologies used for studying people.
- I started my career in 2014 in a consultancy, then moved to a big corporate, and later settled in the startup world. It has been more than 7 years since I started doing UX research and I still love it. Currently, I am excited about Developer Experience, especially IT operations. More details in my [CV](https://github.com/AndrejKiri/AndrejKiri/blob/ccfa33fc4baef82f32d1fd9278aa9ea44329faa0/CV.md).
- I grew up in southern Slovakia. Now I live in the Czech Republic. With my wife, we have two little kids and an evil cat. When the kids fall asleep, I play Dota 2. Recently I realized that I love gardening.

### Working with me
- By my nature, I strive to deliver high-quality work and I expect others to aspire to it as well. But, this is a double-edged sword. Not to fall into the trap of perfectionism, I work hard to scope my work appropriately and iterate.
- Sometimes I need time to absorb new information and form an opinion. I often wait to speak in group settings until my thoughts are clear and I believe I can contribute positively to the discussion. Because of this, I prefer async work and I appreciate it when I get materials for meetings in advance.
- I gravitate towards transparency and vulnerability both in my work and personal life. I believe being open about one's mistakes, doubts and fears is better than building a facade of an ideal person because it allows me and others to learn and grow faster.

### Trivia
- In MBTI personality type I score between Advocate [INFJ-T](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality) and Architect [INTJ-T](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality) types. I can relate to both.
- I can blind type in both latin and cyrilic.
- My Dota 2 MMR is 2k (means "rather bad").
